        <p class="Description">
            In winter 2020, Germany went into a Lockdown Light. I was sitting at home, curious about the spatio-temporal distribution of Covid-cases. But even on the internet, I did not find what I was looking for.
            I wanted a map with all districts (Landkreise) to be plotted over time so you could see the spatial distribution of Covid-cases during the pandemic. At that time, detailed Covid data was publicly available 
            (I wanted to make an update of the video but I did not find the data anymore. Please contact me, if you know where to find this data)
            and thus I decided to create my own map. I was inspired by the dashboard of the RKI but also by the youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DataIsBeautifulOfficial/videos">Data Is Beautiful</a>. 
            On the channel, you can find great animated bar charts that are perfect for visualizing the development of events. I also wanted to highlight the age structure of people with a Covid infection. 
            I thought this might fit in one video, and here it is.

        <h2 class="Page_Section">How long will we have to live with the consequences of our vote?</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            The choices we make today determine our future. Fortunately, we live in a democracy in which everyone can influence decisions with their vote. 
            The many crises we are facing present us with major challenges that we must overcome as a society. We do not always agree on which measures 
            are best suited to overcoming the crises. There are disagreements between the generations in particular. Germany is getting older and so 
            one might assume that decisions are being made at shorter notice. Of course, I don't want to imply that, but I was still interested in the 
            age distribution of voters and how long voters in an age group have to live with today's decisions. To do this, I took data on life expectancy 
            from the Federal Statistical Office and combined it with voter data from the German Bundestag. I first plotted the whole thing as a pie chart. 
            Inside the circle you can see the proportion of voters in an age group. On the outside you can see the proportion of life expectancy in the age group. 
            Voters up to 39 make up 50% of the life expectancy, but they only have about 25% of the votes. As beautiful as a pie chart is, it is unfortunately 
            not clear and easy to understand. I have therefore presented the same information again in a bar chart. You can see that the 21-29 year olds only 
            account for 11% of the votes, but 20% of the lifespan. Of course, everyone is worth the same, regardless of age and gender! 
            But we need to pay attention to our democracy when young people feel that their voice is not being heard.

        <h2 class="Page_Section">How much do I have to pay for a house and where are houses least expansive?</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Many people dream of owning their own home. However, house prices have risen sharply in recent years, 
            making the dream of owning a home a distant prospect for many. I wanted to know where houses are particularly 
            expensive and where you can get the biggest plots of land to go with a house, because there has to be room for the 
            <a href="Quails.html">quail coop</a> somewhere. 
            Together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-bollenbach/">Lukas</a>, 
            I scraped the data of around 100,000 houses from a property platform and turned the data into a dashboard. 
            For legal reasons, I am unfortunately unable to share the dashboard. 
            But I would like to give you a brief insight into the data.

        <h2 class="Page_Section" style="margin-top: 50px">Price per m²</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Here we can see how the prices per square metre differ in Germany. 
            Conurbations such as Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and the Ruhr area 
            are clearly recognisable. Houses are clearly the most expensive in the Munich area. 
            What I find particularly interesting is the influence that Berlin has on house prices 
            and that house prices fall sharply behind this area.
        </p>

        <h2 class="Page_Section" style="margin-top: 50px">Property Size</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            The situation is quite different when it comes to plot sizes. 
            In urban centres, there are only small plots of land for houses. 
            In rural regions, especially in north-east Germany, the plots of land 
            associated with the house are much larger. In the Uckermark, house buyers receive an average of 1742m² of additional land.

        <h2 class="Page_Section" style="margin-top: 50px">Number of Houses</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Of course, there are not the same number of houses on offer everywhere. 
            More houses are sold in some districts than in others. The availability of houses certainly 
            has an influence on the price of property. However, it would be interesting to include 
            demographic data in the assessment.

        <h2 class="Page_Section" style="margin-top: 50px">Price Variations</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Wow, this map has some cow patches! Here we look at the variability of house prices. 
            In some counties house prices are very different. We need to look at the percentage 
            variability here because otherwise the absolute variability would be higher for 
            districts with high house prices. Apart from the fact that in the districts around 
            Berlin the house price depends very much on the proximity to Berlin, I cannot interpret 
            the patterns here. However, I find it interesting that the price variability around 
            Munich is very low. It seems that all houses are expensive here, or that the price of 
            land is much higher than the price of houses.
        </p>

        <h2 class="Page_Section" style="margin-top: 50px">Room Size</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Where are the rooms particularly large? This question may be trivial, 
            but if the data is there, why shouldn't we show it? Above all, 
            I think we can see that there are only a few districts with particularly small 
            or particularly large rooms. In the Stuttgart / Zollernalbkreis area the rooms 
            are rather small, in Forchheim, but also in the most expensive district of Miesbach, 
            the rooms are large. I don't understand why people in Miesbach prefer particularly 
            large rooms when the price per square metre is so enormous. 
            Perhaps the typical DINKs (Double Income No Kids) live here.

        <h2 class="Page_Section" style="margin-top: 50px">Some Remarks</h2>
        <p class="Description">
            Of course, this superficial analysis cannot say much. 
            In the future, we want to scrape some more data, such as the year of construction, 
            the energy certificate and the features. This would allow us to analyse, for example, 
            to what extent the year of construction or the energy certificate have an influence 
            on the price and whether certain features in particular determine the price. 
            A time dimension would be very interesting to assess trends. It would be 
            interesting to see which houses sell particularly quickly and which stay in the system longer.

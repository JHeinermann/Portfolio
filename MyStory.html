                    I didn't want to go straight to university after school and wanted to spend a gap year abroad. 
                    Madagascar was the perfect country: completely different nature, completely different culture 
                    and above all, lots of geckos! I had already kept Madagascan reptiles in a terrarium and had 
                    met a professor from Braunschweig at a conference who told me that I could spend a year 
                    there studying the behaviour of frogs. <br> <br> 
                    So, naive as I was, I set off for Madagascar. When I arrived in the 
                    small town of Andasibe, I was able to stay with a Malagasy family and learn about their rich 
                    culture. Among other things, I learnt how to cook the perfect rice and that a lot more people 
                    can fit in a car than you might think. I asked lots of questions to better understand the culture 
                    and even learned to speak a little Malagasy. <br> <br> 
                    Madagascar's biodiversity left me speechless as I found more geckos, chameleons, snakes and 
                    frogs than I could count during my stay. I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to go on this 
                    trip and meet so many amazing people!

                <p id="print_output2">
                    During my stay in Madagascar, I realized that I no longer wanted to study biology because I 
                    missed the human side of it. Instead, I decided to study forest sciences at the TU Dresden, 
                    which has the second oldest department of forest sciences in the world. 
                    Forest sciences combine biology with economics, society and sustainability, taking 
                    a more holistic view of natural ressources. <br> <br>
                    This diverse degree programme includes subjects such as silviculture, forest economics, 
                    history, inventory, biodiversity, zoology, botany and statistics. I gained the ability to
                    think long-term, beyond decades, and to consider multiple perspectives, from conservation 
                    to hunting, recreation, and economics. <br> <br>
                    Driven by a curiosity for new scientific methods, I was particularly drawn to 
                    integrated pest management. This fascinating approach minimizes the use of pesticides, 
                    by using natural antagonists. My fascination was expressed in my bachelor thesis, where I 
                    examined statistical models for evaluating new bark beetle traps.  <br> <br>
                    During my masters, I worked in the award-winning "Biowild" Project in which I used my
                    R-skills to improve data cleansing and to automate statistical analysis and visualization.
                    While helping friends and fellow students with programming and statistics of their thesis,
                    I recognized that many students lack some basic R-knowledge. I therefore designed a course
                    titled "R - programming and statistics for your thesis". <br> <br>
                    For my master thesis, I delved deeper into modelling and explored the influence of poplar leaf 
                    beetles on poplar growth. I wanted to know under which circumstances, insecticide application
                    could be economically justified. The model was planned as a tool to help farmers decide whether
                    to use pesticide or not instead of a preventive application of pesticides. <br> <br>
                    The model I used is an 'individual-based model', which simulates single individuals and focuses on 
                    interactions between individuals and between individuals and their environment. 
                    I wanted to learn more about these models and decided to start a PhD.

                <p id="print_output2">
                    The pine forests of north-eastern Germany are dominated by a single tree species. 
                    This homogeneity reduces biodiversity and poses a significant risk. A single fungus, extreme weather event 
                    or insect infestation could devastate the entire ecosystem. Foresters are therefore converting pure stands 
                    into diverse mixed forests. However, predicting the growth and interactions within these multi-species 
                    communities is a unique challenge. <br> <br>
                    Unlike traditional models that treat forests as a single unit, 
                    individual-based models allow us to simulate the growth and interactions of individual trees within a forest, 
                    providing a detailed picture of the dynamic ecosystem. I am developing an individual-based model that focuses 
                    on the regeneration of young forests. Although the early years of a forest are crucial for predicting long-term 
                    forest composition and growth, they are difficult to describe and have not yet been simulated in detail in forest 
                    growth models. <br> <br>
                    Forest dynamics are driven by competition between trees for resources, especially light and water, 
                    so water and light availability and it's effects on young tree growth are key components of my model. Light availability 
                    is calculated for each tree within the canopy, taking into account complex interactions between neighbouring trees of 
                    different species and sizes. Water competition, especially during the scarce summer months, is also modelled in 
                    great detail, revealing the dynamic struggle for survival. <br> <br>
                    By incorporating different climate change scenarios into 
                    our models, we can predict the potential impact of drought and management interventions on tree growth and species 
                    composition, allowing us to proactively adapt forest management strategies. This foresight enables us to build 
                    resilient forests that can thrive in the face of a changing climate.
